# How Does NepaliPay Work?

NepaliPay operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), leveraging blockchain technology to provide secure, transparent financial services.

## The Technology Stack

1. **Smart Contracts** - Self-executing code on the blockchain that handles all transactions and business logic
2. **Web3 Integration** - Connects your wallet (like MetaMask) to the blockchain
3. **Frontend Application** - The user interface you interact with
4. **Blockchain Network** - The underlying Binance Smart Chain that processes and records all transactions

## Transaction Flow

When you perform an action in NepaliPay, here's what happens:

1. Your request is initiated through the app interface
2. The app creates a transaction and sends it to your Web3 wallet
3. You approve the transaction in your wallet
4. The transaction is broadcast to the Binance Smart Chain
5. Miners on the network process and validate the transaction
6. The transaction is recorded on the blockchain
7. The app updates to reflect the completed transaction

## Smart Contract Interactions

NepaliPay uses three main smart contracts:

- **NepaliPayToken (NPT)** - Handles the NPT token economy
- **NepaliPay** - Manages core functionality like transfers and loans
- **FeeRelayer** - Optimizes gas fees for a better user experience

All smart contracts are verified and audited for security, with their code publicly available for inspection on BscScan.

# Safety Tips for NepaliPay Users

Follow these guidelines to ensure a secure and positive experience with NepaliPay.

## Protect Your Wallet

- **Never share your recovery phrase or private keys** with anyone, including NepaliPay support staff
