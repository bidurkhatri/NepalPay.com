In the NepaliPay app, the collateral system is a key feature of its micro-loan functionality, designed to provide users with quick access to NepaliPay Tokens (NPT) while ensuring the platform remains secure and sustainable. Below, I’ll explain how collateral works in a clear, detailed, and user-friendly way, focusing on the application perspective—how users like Raju (a momo vendor) or Sita (a student) interact with it, what it means for them, and how it fits into the NepaliPay ecosystem. This explanation aligns with the NepalPay.sol smart contract logic you shared earlier, but avoids deep technical jargon, keeping it practical and accessible.

How Collateral Works in NepaliPay
What is Collateral?
Collateral in NepaliPay is a digital asset (like BNB, ETH, or BTC) that you “lock” in the app to borrow NPT, the app’s currency where 1 NPT equals 1 Nepalese Rupee (NPR). Think of it as a deposit or security—like leaving your bike with a friend to borrow their scooter. You don’t lose the collateral unless you fail to repay the loan; it’s just held temporarily to guarantee you’ll pay back what you borrow.
Why Use Collateral?
NepaliPay uses collateral to:
	•	Enable Fast Loans: No bank visits or credit checks—just lock an asset and get NPT instantly.
	•	Protect the System: It ensures there’s something to cover the loan if you can’t repay, keeping NepaliPay fair for everyone.
	•	Empower Users: Even if you don’t have NPT, you can use other crypto you own (e.g., BNB) to access funds.
How Does It Work? (Step-by-Step)
Here’s how Raju, a momo vendor, uses collateral to borrow NPT, based on the app’s Borrow page:
	1	Adding Collateral
	◦	Where: Dashboard → “Borrow” → “Add Collateral” tab.
	◦	Action: Raju taps “Add Collateral” and sees a dropdown with options: BNB, ETH, BTC. He has 1 BNB (worth ~300 NPR at current rates) in his MetaMask wallet, so he selects “BNB”.
	◦	Amount: He enters “1” (1 BNB), sees “Value: ~300 NPT”, and clicks “Add” (green button).
	◦	Process: MetaMask pops up—he signs the transaction. The 1 BNB moves from his wallet to NepaliPay’s system, where it’s locked.
	◦	Result: The app shows “Collateral Added: 1 BNB (~300 NPT)”—it’s now his safety net for borrowing.
	2	Taking a Loan
	◦	Where: “Borrow” → “Take Loan” tab.
	◦	Action: Raju sees a slider (1-50,000 NPT, capped by collateral). With 1 BNB (~300 NPT), he can borrow up to 200 NPT (due to a 150% collateral ratio—more on this below).
	◦	Details: He slides to “200 NPT”, sees “5% interest over 30 days” (total repayable: 205 NPT), and clicks “Borrow” (blue button).
	◦	Process: MetaMask prompts again—he signs. The system sends 200 NPT to his wallet, and his debt is recorded as 205 NPT.
	◦	Result: His balance jumps from 0 to “200 NPT”, and “Debt: 205 NPT” appears under “Repay Loan”.
	3	Repaying the Loan
	◦	Where: “Borrow” → “Repay Loan” tab.
	◦	Action: After earning 300 NPT from momo sales, Raju taps “Repay Loan”. He sees “205 NPT due” and “~2.5 NPT rebate if repaid early” (e.g., within 10 days). He enters “205 NPT” and clicks “Repay” (red button).
	◦	Process: MetaMask signs the transaction—205 NPT moves back to NepaliPay, clearing his debt.
	◦	Result: His collateral (1 BNB) is unlocked and returned to his wallet, plus he gets a ~2.5 NPT rebate for early repayment. Balance adjusts (e.g., 95 NPT left from 300).
	4	What Happens if You Don’t Repay?
	◦	Deadline: Loans are due in 30 days. If Raju doesn’t repay by day 35, an admin (e.g., Anil) can “liquidate” his loan.
	◦	Liquidation: The system takes his 1 BNB collateral to cover the 205 NPT debt. Any excess value (e.g., if 1 BNB is now worth 350 NPT) might be lost or partially refunded, depending on updates to the system.
	◦	Result: Debt clears, but Raju loses his BNB—repaying on time keeps it safe.
Key Rules for Collateral
	•	Accepted Assets: BNB, ETH, BTC—common cryptocurrencies users might own.
	•	Collateral Ratio: You need 150% of the loan amount in collateral. For 200 NPT, Raju locks ~300 NPT worth (1 BNB), ensuring the system has a buffer.
	•	Interest: 5% annually, prorated for 30 days (e.g., 200 NPT loan = 5 NPT interest).
	•	Value Fluctuation: Collateral value can change (e.g., if BNB drops to 250 NPR, it’s still locked at 1 BNB). You owe NPT, not the collateral’s current worth.
	•	Max Loan: Capped at 50,000 NPT per user, but limited by your collateral (e.g., 1 BNB → ~200 NPT max).
Example in Action
	•	Raju’s Goal: Buy dough for momos (200 NPR).
	•	Collateral: Locks 1 BNB (~300 NPR).
	•	Loan: Borrows 200 NPT (~200 NPR).
	•	Spends: Sends 200 NPT to his supplier.
	•	Earns: Sells momos, makes 300 NPT.
	•	Repays: Pays 205 NPT on day 10, gets 1 BNB back + ~2.5 NPT rebate.
	•	Outcome: Keeps 95 NPT profit, BNB returned—business grows!
User Benefits
	•	Speed: Borrow 200 NPT in minutes—no paperwork.
	•	Flexibility: Use BNB/ETH/BTC you already have.
	•	Control: Repay early, save fees, reclaim collateral anytime.
	•	Access: No bank account needed—just a wallet.
Risks to Know
	•	Price Drops: If BNB falls (e.g., from 300 NPR to 200 NPR), you still owe 205 NPT, and liquidation might not cover it fully.
	•	Non-Repayment: Miss the 30-day deadline, and your 1 BNB is gone.
	•	Wallet Safety: Lose your MetaMask key, and you lose access to collateral and NPT.
How It Fits NepaliPay
Collateral powers NepaliPay’s micro-loan system, letting users like Sita borrow 200 NPT for books or Raju fund his stall—driving Nepal’s micro-economy. It’s tied to the app’s purpose: financial inclusion without barriers. The 5% interest and fees (e.g., gas rebates) fund operations, while the 150% ratio keeps the system solvent, balancing user empowerment with stability.

Summary
In NepaliPay, collateral is your ticket to borrowing NPT—lock 1 BNB, get 200 NPT, repay 205 NPT, and retrieve your BNB. It’s simple, fast, and Nepal-friendly, but requires timely repayment to avoid losing your asset. Need more details or a tweak? Let me know!
