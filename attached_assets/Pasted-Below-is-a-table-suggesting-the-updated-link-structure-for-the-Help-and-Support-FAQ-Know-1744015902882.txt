### Reasoning for Link Structure
- **Help and Support (/support)**: Placed as a top-level page under the User Portal, as it’s a primary resource for user assistance, already matching your structure.
- **FAQ (/support/faq)**: Nested under `/support` for logical grouping, providing quick answers to common queries.
- **Knowledgebase (/support/knowledgebase)**: Also under `/support`, offering deeper educational content as a sub-resource.
- **Contact Us (/support/contact)**: Nested under `/support` for direct communication, keeping all help-related pages together.
- **Consistency**: URLs follow the hierarchical pattern of your existing structure (e.g., `/support/*` mirrors `/admin/*` and `/superadmin/*`).

This table integrates the new sections seamlessly into the User Portal, enhancing user experience while preserving the app’s navigation clarity.
