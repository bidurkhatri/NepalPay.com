## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for Users

### 1. What is NepaliPay?
**Answer**: NepaliPay is a mobile and web app that lets you send money, borrow, earn rewards, and advertise—all using NepaliPay Tokens (NPT), where 1 NPT equals 1 Nepalese Rupee (NPR). Think of it as a digital wallet for Nepal, as easy as using cash but with extra perks!

### 2. How do I start using NepaliPay?
**Answer**: Visit `nepalipay.com/sections`, click "Get Started," and connect your wallet (like MetaMask) set to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Choose a unique username (e.g., "RajuKtm"), confirm the transaction, and you’re in! Add some NPT to your wallet to begin.

### 3. Is NepaliPay safe to use?
**Answer**: Yes! Your funds are stored in your personal wallet, not with us—you control them. We use secure technology to protect transactions, and our team reviews ads and loans to keep things fair. Still, keep your wallet details private to stay extra safe.

### 4. What can I do with NepaliPay?
**Answer**: You can:
- Send NPT to friends or vendors (like paying for momos).
- Borrow NPT by locking collateral (e.g., BNB).
- Earn rewards—like 10 NPT for inviting friends or avatars for sending money.
- Post or browse ads to sell or buy locally.

### 5. How much does it cost to use?
**Answer**: Sending NPT has a small fee—about 0.05% plus a tiny gas fee (usually under 5 NPT, ~5 NPR). Borrowing has 5% interest over 30 days, and ads cost 500 NPT (Base), 1,000 NPT (Wings), or 15,000+ NPT (Crest). Fees are clear before you confirm!

### 6. Can I get my money back if I make a mistake?
**Answer**: Once you send NPT or post an ad, it’s final—like cash. Double-check details before confirming. If an ad is rejected, you’ll get a refund. For loans, repay early to save on fees and get a rebate!

### 7. What happens if I don’t repay a loan?
**Answer**: If you don’t repay within 30 days, your collateral (e.g., 1 BNB) may be taken to cover the loan. Pay on time to keep it safe—early repayment even earns you a bonus!

### 8. How do I contact support?
**Answer**: Click the "Need Help?" chat bubble on `nepalipay.com/sections`—available in Nepali and English. We’ll reply fast to assist with payments, loans, or ads.

### 9. Why do ads need approval?
**Answer**: Our team checks ads to ensure they’re real—no scams or fakes. If it’s legit (e.g., "Fresh Momos"), it goes live fast—usually within a day!

### 10. Can I use NepaliPay without a smartphone?
**Answer**: You’ll need a smartphone or computer with internet and a wallet like MetaMask. It’s designed for mobile, so even a basic phone with a browser works—just visit `nepalipay.com/sections`.

## Basic Knowledge and Education About Risks

### What You Need to Know
- **NPT is Like NPR**: 1 NPT = 1 NPR—it’s your digital rupee, easy to use.
- **Your Wallet is Your Bank**: NepaliPay uses a wallet (e.g., MetaMask)—it’s yours, not ours. You control your NPT.
- **Fees are Small**: Sending NPT costs ~5 NPR, borrowing has 5% interest—cheaper than banks!
- **Collateral is Key**: To borrow, lock crypto (like BNB)—it’s your safety net, returned when you repay.
- **Ads Need Approval**: Post ads to sell—our team checks them to keep out fakes.

### How to Use NepaliPay Safely
1. **Protect Your Wallet**: Your wallet has a secret key (like a password)—never share it, or someone could take your NPT.
2. **Check Before Sending**: Type usernames carefully—no refunds if you send to the wrong person!
3. **Repay Loans on Time**: Borrow 200 NPT? Pay 205 NPT in 30 days—or lose your collateral (e.g., 1 BNB).
4. **Post Honest Ads**: Fake ads get rejected—you lose time, not NPT (refunded).
5. **Start Small**: New? Try 20 NPT first—learn as you go.

### Risks to Understand
- **Wallet Loss**: If you lose your wallet key (e.g., forget it), your NPT is gone—no recovery like a bank.
- **Price Risk**: NPT aims for 1 NPR, but if our system fails (rare!), it might wobble—check your balance often.
- **Collateral Risk**: Borrowing locks crypto—if its value drops (e.g., BNB falls), you still owe the full NPT amount.
- **Internet Risk**: No internet? No NepaliPay—keep your phone charged and connected.
- **Scam Risk**: Someone pretends to be "RajuKtm"? Verify usernames—don’t trust strangers.

### Education Tips
- **Learn Your Wallet**: Practice with MetaMask—send 10 NPT to a friend first.
- **Ask Us**: Stuck? Use "Need Help?"—we’ll guide you in Nepali or English.
- **Stay Updated**: Prices (like BNB) change—check your collateral value in "Borrow".
- **Be Patient**: Ads take a day to approve—plan ahead!

### Why It’s Worth It
NepaliPay isn’t risky like gambling—it’s a tool like cash, just digital. With small fees, instant payments, and rewards, it’s Nepal’s way to save time and money. Start with 20 NPT, grow to 1,000—your rupees, your rules.
