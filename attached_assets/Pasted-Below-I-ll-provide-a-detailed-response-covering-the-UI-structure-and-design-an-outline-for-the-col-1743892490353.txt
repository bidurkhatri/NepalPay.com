Below, I’ll provide a detailed response covering the UI structure and design, an outline for the collateral feature, and the function behind it within the NepaliPay app’s User Interface (nepalipay.com/sections). This will focus on the application perspective—how users interact with collateral through the UI, what they see and do, and how it works behind the scenes in a user-friendly way. I’ll integrate this into the existing UI flow (Landing Page → Login/Get Started → Dashboard), with emphasis on the Borrow section where collateral lives, aligning with your prior questions about collateral mechanics.

NepaliPay User Interface: nepalipay.com/sections
Flow: Landing Page → Get Started/Login → Enter Details → Dashboard (/home) Design Theme: Himalayan blue backdrop, red accents, Nepali-inspired icons (e.g., rupee stack for loans), Nepali/English toggle.

Function Behind Collateral
How It Works (User Perspective):
	1	Adding Collateral:
	◦	What Happens: Raju selects “BNB” and enters “1”. The app checks his MetaMask wallet (via BSC), shows “~300 NPT” based on current rates, and he signs. The 1 BNB locks in NepaliPay’s system—not spent, just held.
	◦	Why: This proves Raju can back a loan, letting him borrow up to 200 NPT (150% collateral ratio).
	2	Taking a Loan:
	◦	What Happens: Raju slides to “200 NPT”, sees “205 NPT to repay” (200 + 5% interest over 30 days), and signs. The app sends 200 NPT to his wallet, records “Debt: 205 NPT”, and keeps his 1 BNB locked.
	◦	Why: The collateral (1 BNB) covers the loan if unpaid, ensuring NepaliPay stays solvent while Raju gets funds.
	3	Repaying the Loan:
	◦	What Happens: Raju earns 300 NPT, enters “205 NPT” on day 10, sees a ~2.5 NPT rebate (early bonus), and signs. The app takes 205 NPT, unlocks his 1 BNB, and adds the rebate—balance becomes 95 NPT.
	◦	Why: Repayment frees his collateral and rewards early action, encouraging timely use.
	4	If Unpaid (Liquidation):
	◦	What Happens: After 30 days, if Raju doesn’t repay, an admin sees “Overdue” on admin.nepalipay.com, clicks “Liquidate”, and signs. The 1 BNB is taken to cover the 205 NPT debt—Raju loses it.
	◦	Why: This protects the system, ensuring loans don’t drain NPT reserves.
Key Functions:
	•	Locking Mechanism: Collateral (e.g., 1 BNB) is held in the app’s system, not spent, until repaid or liquidated.
	•	Ratio Check: 150% collateral (300 NPT worth for 200 NPT loan) balances risk—Raju can’t over-borrow.
	•	Interest: 5% annual rate, prorated for 30 days (e.g., 200 NPT × 5% ÷ 12 = ~5 NPT), funds operations.
	•	Real-Time Value: Collateral value (e.g., “300 NPT”) updates with market rates, but debt stays in NPT.
	•	Rebate: Early repayment (e.g., within 10 days) refunds ~50% of gas fees (~2.5 NPT), incentivizing quick returns.
User Experience:
	•	Raju’s Flow: Locks 1 BNB, borrows 200 NPT for dough, repays 205 NPT after sales, gets BNB back—simple, fast, no bank hassle.
	•	Visuals: Slider shows “200 NPT (~200 NPR)”, rebate in green, debt in red—clear and Nepal-friendly.
	•	Safety: Collateral stays safe unless unpaid past 30 days—Raju controls the outcome.

Summary
	•	UI Structure: Collateral lives in “Borrow” on the Dashboard, with tabs (Add Collateral, Take Loan, Repay Loan) for a step-by-step flow.
	•	Design: Blue/red scheme, intuitive inputs (dropdowns, sliders), real-time NPR feedback, success popups.
	•	Function: Lock BNB/ETH/BTC, borrow NPT (up to 66% of collateral value), repay with 5% interest, unlock collateral—secure, user-driven, with early repayment perks.
This blends UI clarity with collateral’s practical role, empowering users like Raju while keeping NepaliPay stable. Need more detail or a tweak? Let me know!
