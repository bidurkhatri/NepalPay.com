refine the UI structure for **nepalipay.com/sections** (User Interface) to explicitly include a **Settings** section, and detail the **Landing Page**, **Login Page**, and **Dashboard** with a clear flow: *Landing Page → Get Started/Login → Enter Details → Dashboard (/home)*. This will align with your request, ensuring a user-friendly onboarding process while maintaining NepaliPay’s purpose of financial empowerment and commerce. Below, I’ll define where **Settings** fits, what’s on each page, and what’s in the **Dashboard**, using a text-based outline for clarity.
